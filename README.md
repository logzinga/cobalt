## What's cobalt?
cobalt is social and media platform downloader that doesn't piss you off.

It's fast, friendly, and doesn't have any bullshit that modern web is filled with: no ads, trackers, or analytics.  
Paste the link, get the video, move on. It's that simple. Just how it should be.

*Reliability of downloads from Twitter is questionable due to its current management.

## cobalt API
cobalt has an open API that you can use in your projects for **free**.  
It's easy and straightforward to use, [check out the docs](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt/blob/current/docs/API.md) and see for yourself.  
Feel free to use the main API instance ([co.wuk.sh](https://co.wuk.sh/)) in your projects.

## Host an instance yourself
### Requirements
- Node.js 18 or above
- git

Setup script installs all needed `npm` dependencies, but you have to install `Node.js` and `git` yourself.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/wukko/cobalt`
2. Run setup script and follow instructions: `npm run setup`
3. Run cobalt via `npm start`
4. Done.

You need to host API and web app separately since v.6.0. Setup script will help you with that!

### Ubuntu 22.04+ workaround
`nscd` needs to be installed and running so that the `ffmpeg-static` binary can resolve DNS ([#101](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt/issues/101#issuecomment-1494822258)):

```bash
sudo apt install nscd
sudo service nscd start
```

### Docker
It's also possible to run cobalt via Docker. I *highly* recommend using Docker compose.  
Check out the [example compose file](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt/blob/current/docker-compose.example.yml) and alter it for your needs.

## Disclaimer
cobalt is my passion project, so update schedule depends solely on my free time, motivation, and mood.  
Don't expect any consistency in that.
